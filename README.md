# task_manager

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Overview
TaskManager is a Flutter app demonstrating task listing, creation, and filtering using BLoC, with network calls against a mock REST API for todos. The app persists nothing remotely; network responses are echoed for demo purposes.

Project setup
Prerequisites:

Flutter SDK installed and on PATH; run flutter doctor to verify.

Android Studio or Xcode tooling for platform builds.

Clone and install:

git clone https://github.com/eleminatorcode/TaskManager.git && cd TaskManager, then flutter pub get.

Run:

flutter run to launch on an attached device/emulator.

Build release:

Android: flutter build apk or flutter build appbundle.

Android Internet permission:

Already set in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>.

Notes:

JSONPlaceholder simulates writes; POST/PUT return 201/200 but GET responses remain static. The app updates local state to reflect creates.

APIs used
JSONPlaceholder Todos (mock REST)

Base: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

Endpoints used:

GET /todos — fetch list of todos.

POST /todos — simulate creating a todo; returns 201 with echoed body and a fake id.

Behavior:

Write operations are not persisted; subsequent GETs won’t include newly created items. This is by design for the mock API.

Folder structure
lib/ — app source code. Typical organization follows a simple layer-first structure for clarity.

bloctask/ — BLoC files for tasks (events, states, bloc).

models/ — Dart data models (e.g., Task/Todo).

repositories/ — API repository layer (HTTP calls to JSONPlaceholder).

screens/ — UI screens/widgets (Task list, Add task).

widgets/ — Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs).

main.dart — app entry point and route setup.

android/, ios/ — platform-specific projects generated by Flutter tooling.

pubspec.yaml — dependencies and assets.

test/ — unit/widget tests.

Running with BLoC
The app provides TaskBloc at the root; UI dispatches events like TaskAdd(title, description) and listens for states to rebuild. This mirrors common Flutter BLoC patterns.

Common pitfalls
Network errors on device:

Ensure internet permission in AndroidManifest (already included) and correct HTTPS URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).[3]

POST not visible in GET:

JSONPlaceholder returns 201 with an echoed object but does not persist it; rely on local state to show new items.

Scripts and commands
Fetch dependencies: flutter pub get.

Format code: flutter format .

Analyze: flutter analyze.

Run tests: flutter test.

License
MIT or your preferred license.
